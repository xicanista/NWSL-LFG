# ⚽ NWSL-LFG
The NWSL deserves cutting-edge fan engagement tech.

**NWSL Fan Personalization Engine**
A backend AI-powered personalization platform that helps National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) fans engage more deeply with content, buy merch they love, and find the best upcoming matches to attend.

Built as a 90-day project focused on real-time behavioral analytics, recommendation systems, and generative AI — with Phase 2 planned for full frontend integration and deployment.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- 📊 **Tracks user behavior** across content, merch, and match engagement
- 🎯 **Recommends** games, articles, and products based on user interests
- 🧠 **Uses GPT** to generate personalized blurbs and ticket invites

---

## 🧱 Stack

- **Python** — Primary language
- **PostgreSQL** — Relational database for user and match data
- **NumPy or Scikit-learn** — For clustering and content-based recommendation models
- **OpenAI GPT** — For dynamic copy generation
- **ASA API (`itscalledsoccer`)** — To fetch NWSL match data
